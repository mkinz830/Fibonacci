## ðŸ“˜ What is the Fibonacci Sequence?

The **Fibonacci sequence** is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. It typically starts with:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...


It appears in various areas of mathematics, computer science, and even nature â€” such as in the arrangement of leaves or the pattern of a pine cone.
